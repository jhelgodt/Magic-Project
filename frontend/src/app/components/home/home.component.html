    <p class="home__info">
      If you're not logged in, you can still create decks — just make sure to
      check <em>"Make this deck public"</em> in the form. Public decks will show
      up under Deckbuilder for everyone to explore.
    </p>

    <h2 class="home__subtitle">⏳ Server Wake-Up Notice</h2>
    <p class="home__info">
      Our backend is hosted on Render’s free tier. It might take a few seconds
      for public decks to appear when you first visit — especially if the server
      has been idle. Hang tight, they’ll show up soon!
    </p>
