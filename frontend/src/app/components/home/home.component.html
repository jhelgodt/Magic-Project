    <h1>Welcome to the Magic Deck Builder</h1>
    <p>
      This is a web-based tool for building and browsing Magic: The Gathering
      Commander decks. Whether you're a seasoned player or just starting out,
      this app is designed to help you build, manage, and explore decks with
      ease.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>🔍 Browse decks:</strong> View public Commander decks created by
        others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>🛠️ Build your own:</strong> Use the deck builder to create
        custom decks using real cards from the Scryfall database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>🔐 Log in with Google:</strong> Sign in to save your personal
        decks and access them from anywhere.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Note About Performance</h2>
    <p>
      The backend server is hosted on Render’s free tier. This means it may take
      a few seconds to "wake up" if it hasn’t been used in a while — especially
      the first time you load your decks. Once the app is active, everything
      should run much faster. Thanks for your patience!
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      Use the navigation above to explore public decks or start building your
      own. Logged-in users can view and manage their saved decks under
      <strong>"Your Decks"</strong>.
